### Hi there, I'm Luke 👋

I'm a 14 year old web developer from New Jersey.

Right now, I'm mostly working on [Spacebin](https://spaceb.in), a powerful text-sharing app built with TypeScript, Express, and TypeORM. I have experience in TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Golang, and Ruby.

I currently run Artix as my operating system, runit as my init system, and bspwm as my window manager. All of my system configurations are tracked and updated in lukewhrit/dotfiles

You can find me on [🦜 Twitter](https://twitter.com/luke_324), [🎥 Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/Luke_324/), [🔑 Keybase](https://keybase.io/luke324), or [🌐 My Own Website](https://lukewhrit.xyz).
