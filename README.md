### Hi there, I'm Luke 👋

I'm a 14 year old web developer from New Jersey.

Right now, I'm mostly working on [Spacebin](spacebin-org/spacebin), a powerful text-sharing app built with Go, Fiber, and GORM. I have experience in TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Golang, and Ruby.

I currently run Artix, runit, and bspwm. All of my system configurations are stored in my [dotfiles](lukewhrit/dotfiles) repository.

You can find me on [🦜 Twitter](https://twitter.com/luke_324), [🎥 Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/Luke_324/), [🔑 Keybase](https://keybase.io/luke324), or [🌐 My Own Website](https://lukewhrit.xyz).
