## Hi there, I'm Luke 👋

I'm a [bisexual](https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/Bisexual) and [genderfluid](https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/Genderfluid) 15 year old software engineer and Linux system administrator from New Jersey. I mostly work in Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and some Ruby.

My birth name is Luke but since I’m [genderfluid](https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/Genderfluid) I often go by the name Ava in a number of places. Most of the time I prefer Ava so I ask that you use it, however, if you prefer to use Luke that is also fine.

I've been programming for a few years now. I've worked on a ton of projects in that time, most of my recent ones are available on [Github](https://github.com/lukewhrit) for all to see and make use of.

I'm a strong believer in [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and therefore almost all of the projects I contribute to are open. Recently, I've worked on a few projects of note, such as [Spacebin](https://spaceb.in), [Juno Hosting](https://hosting.junodevs.tech) and [Scarecrow](https://github.com/lukewhrit/scarecrow).

You can find me on [🦜 Twitter](https://twitter.com/luke_324), [🎥 Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/Luke_324/), [🔑 Keybase](https://keybase.io/luke324), or [🌐 My Own Website](https://lwhr.xyz).
